# DinnerWiz

Description: *Figuring out what to eat to dinner each night is not an easy thing to do 365 days a year. That's why I created Dinner Wizard. This program will assist you by suggesting a weekly menu based on your preferences. It's very easy to use and the result is a nice looking menu that you can use and print for inspiration.*

A Windows application written in VB6 that I initially made for my mother, and later released as freeware. For more information and binary downloads please visit http://rlvision.com/dinnerwiz/about.asp
