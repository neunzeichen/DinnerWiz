<font size=+1 face=arial><b>Background</b></font>
<p>
I grew up in a family probably like most others. My mother had the same problem each and every day: what to cook for dinner? And I don't blame her. Coming up with dinner suggestions 365 days a year is hard work!
<p>
 Now as an grown up computer programmer I came up with the idea of making a program to help her with this. The program turned out pretty nice, and since she is not alone with this problem I have decided to release it to the world!

<p>
<font size=+1 face=arial><b>How it Works</b></font>
<p>
First you need to enter all dinner suggestions you can think of. Tip: You will probably not be able to remember everything you normally eat, so make it a habit of writing down new dishes whenever you come to think of one.
<p>
The first time you start you will see that I have entered a few common dishes for you. These are just to get you started, and you can safely remove them as you please!
<p>
When you start the program you will see the <i>menu</i> page. By clicking on the menu text the program will randomly create a new menu for the whole week! Note that it is not intended that you stricly follow this menu. The idea is to get inspiration. You can click on the menu several times. Each time a new menu is created!
<p>
Of course, not all dishes are suitable for all days of the week. So here is the smart thing with this program: When you add a new dish, you also select the weekdays you think it is suitable to eat. For example, I like to eat Tacos on Fridays and Saturdays, so I have selected these two days for this particular dish. Now, when you generate a new menu on the first page, the program will take this into consideration and automatically select dishes for each weekday based on your prefereces!
<p>
If the menu does not completely please you, you can click on menu items that you like and they will turn green. Marked items will not be replaced the next time you generate a new menu!

<p>
<font size=+1 face=arial><b>Conclusion</b></font>
<p>
Dinner Wizard is only a small utility. It is not a complete food or recepie program, rather a helpful utility that you run to get ideas. I hope you like it and find it useful!

<font size=+1 face=arial><b>Who Made This Program?</b></font>
<p>
The name is Dan and I run a small website called <a href="http://www.rlvision.com" target="_blank">RL Vision</a> where I publish the software I create. Some are free, some cost a little bit because they have taken many many hours of spare time to make. Dinner Wizard is completely free, but if you like it a small <a href="http://www.rlvision.com/dinnerwiz/donate.asp" target="_blank">donation</a> would make me soooo happy!
